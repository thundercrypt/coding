### Headline with the `h2` Element

Over the next few lessons, we'll build an HTML5 cat photo web app piece-by-piece.

The h2 element adds a level two heading to the web page.

This element tells the browser about the structure of a website. h1 elements are often used for main headings, while h2 elements are generally used for subheadings.

There are also h3, h4, h5 and h6 elements to indicate different levels of subheadings.

#### Assignment

Add an `h2` tag that says "CatPhotoApp" to create a second HTML element below your "Hello World" `h1` element.
