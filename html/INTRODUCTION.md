# HTML5

## What is HTML5?

* HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
* HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
* HTML describes the structure of a Web page.
* HTML consists of a series of elements.
* HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
* HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

## Syntax

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

``` <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname> ```

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

``` <h1>My First Heading</h1> ```
```<p> My first paragraph.</p> ```

## The Use of Web Browsers

The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.

A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:
